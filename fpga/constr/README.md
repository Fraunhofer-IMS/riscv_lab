## Constraints Files

These XDC files are used to assign the physical pins of the FPGA package
to the logical pins of the design's top module. Additionally, pin attributes
like voltage level, driver strength, pull-ups/pull-down, etc. are defined.

Furthermore, the XDC files are used to define IO clock constraints for the
timing analysis.
